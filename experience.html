                <h3>Agile Communications</h3>
                <p>I am so grateful to get the opportunity to develop my skills through hands-on experience in the Agile Communication Research team. Through the Vertically Integrated Project program offered at Georgia Tech, I searched the teams and picked Agile Communications since it is the one that piques my interest in the work it’s contributing to the telecommunications field. Beginning in the Fall 2024 semester, I joined the Hardware sub team where I develop ideas on how best to implement Wi-Fi localization. The hardware sub team started by implementing localization in a controlled wired setup to make sense of the factors that go into accurate localization using Software Defined Radios. We are now gradually moving towards a wireless setup, troubleshooting the issues that come with that switch along the way. Throughout the process of understanding the hardware and its software, our team prepared technical presentations including graphics that demonstrate our knowledge on the theory and our progress in our overall plan to localize wirelessly.</p>
                
                <h3>LJ Mobile Car Care Co-founder</h3>
                <p>My best friend Leo and I started a car cleaning business from the ground up called LJ Mobile Car Care. LJ stands for both of our first names (Leo and Joseph) and since February 2023 we have been building our supply catalog and serving customers all around the Johns Creek area. Throughout this journey, I have developed my cleaning and customer service skills. We have gradually been building a more advanced skill base with more cleaning methods and products. Eventually, after taking a Relational Database class at the University of North Georgia, I designed and updated a database using SQL that kept track of customer and job information like address, date, name, contact information, and price. I am also in the process of developing a website so that the database can be updated in an easier, more intuitive way.</p>

                <h3>Referee</h3>
                <p>For the past ten years, I have worked as a youth referee. Refereeing has given me loads of experience with conflict resolution, quick critical thinking, and teamwork. As the highest level of authority on the field, I must be confident in my decisions and the decisions of my peers working with me. Countless times I’ve had to defend my calls or issue warnings and disciplinary action to players and coaches in a calm and clear manner. Maintaining a level of respect even when it seems everyone is against me, is a skill I had to develop over many seasons. Being a referee requires a great deal of communication skills towards the other members of my referee team and towards everyone involved in the match we are officiating. I’ve had the privilege to officiate a wide range of skill levels and ages in my years as a referee. My years of experience show my dedication to the game of soccer and my eagerness to constantly improve myself professionally.</p>

                        <li>My coursework in the intro Python and Java CS classes at the University of North Georgia and the Data Structures and Algorithms with Java course at Georgia Tech has established a diverse foundation of coding skills that I can replicate with several useful languages.</li>
                        <li>Through a Database class in my sophomore year and experience running the database for my car cleaning business, I've had thorough practice with SQL and database management.</li>
                        <li>I am now starting to touch on lower-level programming languages like Assembly and C that better connect me to my hardware-oriented mindset.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Beginning from a Modern Physics Lab at UNG where we learned the fundamentals of Arduino, culminating in a basketball hoop project, I found my love for bringing my ideas to life through hardware development. That class is what brought the model crane idea to life. I had a much easier time troubleshooting and implementing my own designs.</li>
                        <li>Throughout my coursework, I have learned how to analyze signals on an oscilloscope. Using that machinery has been very helpful for visualizing different attributes of signals and understanding what is going on in the hardware components I make use of.</li>
                        <li>In my Digital Design Lab at Georgia Tech, I learned the ins and outs of programming an FPGA. Whether running simulations on a logic circuit, connecting to external hardware, creating programs running on my state machine design, or utilizing and creating peripherals of SCOMP, I greatly value the volume hands-on experience from that class.</li>
