        <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
        <p>Beginning my college journey as a Computer Science major at the University of North Georgia in the beautiful town of Dahlonega, I built my foundation for Python, Java, and SQL programming while establishing an appreciation for the fundamental courses of engineering and software development. Along with those skills, I also had the privilege of exploring all Dahlonega and its gorgeous surroundings had to offer. After that stage of college, I decided to transfer to Georgia Tech and pursue a degree in Computer Engineering. I joined Delta Upsilon and found a diverse group of people who are helping me grow as a person in many aspects of my life. Going forward, I want to use it’s resources to positively impact the people around me. I’m eager to continue working hard to develop my engineering skills to prepare me for my professional life while enjoying all the aspects of Georgia Tech!</p>
