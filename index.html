            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Computer Engineering student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. After cofounding LJ Mobile Car Care, I used what I learned at the University of North Georgia to create an SQL database to aid operations. At Georgia Tech, I am working to establish my engineering skills, applying them during research. As part of the Agile Communications team, I do work in device localization methods using Wi-Fi signals. I am seeking an internship in automation or hardware integration starting January 2025.</p>

                <h3>LJ Mobile Car Care Co-founder</h3>
                <p>My best friend Leo and I started a car cleaning business from the ground up called LJ Mobile Car Care. LJ stands for both of our first names (Leo and Joseph) and since February 2023 we have been building our supply catalog and serving customers all around the Johns Creek area. Throughout this journey, I have developed my cleaning and customer service skills. We have gradually been building a more advanced skill base with more cleaning methods and products. Eventually, after taking a Relational Database class at the University of North Georgia, I designed and updated a database using SQL that kept track of customer and job information like address, date, name, contact information, and price. I am also in the process of developing a website so that the database can be updated in an easier, more intuitive way.</p>

                        <p>The model crane is a project developed using an Arduino board to control the movement of a small crane. It includes the use of servos for different axis movements. This project was built to explore concepts of embedded control and mechanical movement. I designed and assembled both the physical and electrical components, integrating software logic to allow for smooth operation.</p>
                        <h3>Outline:</h3>
                        <p>For my Discover Project I decided to program an Arduino to create a controller, skeleton, and hardware for a model crane. I built the skeleton of the crane out of cardboard, using half of a box as the base. On top of the base, I built a few extremities to make it look more like a crane, including a control room and a mast so that it had more reach. In terms of electronic components, I used an Arduino Minima R4 Microcontroller, 2 servo motors, 4 buttons, 4 330 Ω resistors, and wires to connect all of the components.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Design:</h3>
                        <p>I wanted to create a small electronic machine that I could control to complete a small goal. I eventually landed on the idea of a crane just walking outside North Avenue, seeing the 500-foot machine erecting a new building right next to the street. I thought back to my childhood when I played with Cranky the Crane and my other Thomas the Tank Engine Trains. I thought back to the pure joy I had playing with that crane and being so excited when I would see a real one driving back from the grocery store with my mom. I decided to follow a simple Arduino Crane tutorial video with a few adjustments.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Problems:</h3>
                        <p>I got all the electronic components in addition to a joystick component. I wrote code in the Arduino IDE to implement the joystick as the controller of the crane. The idea was that pushing the joystick left and right would control a servo at the bottom and pushing the joystick up and down would control a servo on top. The bottom servo controls the top servo’s position, and the top servo controls the arm of the crane. The crane arm got a wide range of motion from this simple two-servo method. Unfortunately, I did not get the correct wires to implement the joystick as a controller. It needed male-to-female wires, but I only had male-to-male wires to connect the components. I decided to pivot to use buttons as the arm controller. I used a method that was intuitive to me to indicate which buttons controlled which: XBOX button colors. I grew up playing on XBOX controllers, so in my mind yellow (Y) is up, green (A) is down, blue (X) is left, and red (B) is right. Although I didn’t put them in a D-Pad structure to give the user an intuitive controller, I was able to control the crane while rarely getting confused.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Hardware Implementation:</h3>
                        <p>I used the Arduino’s VCC and GND probes to power the system and connected the servos and buttons to each of those lines. The buttons required a push up resistor because they didn’t need all 5 volts to function. Because I was using buttons, I had to write new code to implement the buttons as the controls. One thing about buttons is that you have to account for switch bounce. To take care of switch bounce, I added a 8 ms delay in the button detection loops so that it waited after detecting a change in the button status to actually read the new value. I did not implement a method that accounted for switch bounce and then read a continues button value, so in the current implementation, the crane arm is a bit jolty. Overall, I had a lot of fun learning about implementing this design with the microcontroller and electrical components. I also liked designing the physical crane structure out of cardboard so that it looked more crane-like!</p>
